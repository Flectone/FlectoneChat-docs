# death
`server-message.death`

The death module is responsible for death messages

![death](death.png)

## Customizing messages
You can change the death messages in the localization file

```yaml
death:
  natural:
    type: "<player> was slain"
  mob:
    type: "&&1ðŸª¦ &&2<player> &&1was slain by &&2<killer>"
```

## Placeholders

Placeholders are words that may be changed when composing a death message. If a placeholder is in the message, but there is no replacement for it, it will be replaced by an empty string (`""`)
